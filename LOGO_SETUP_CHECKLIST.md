# Logo Upload - Setup Checklist ✅

## Quick Setup Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Migration Complete
```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --local --file=./database/add-logo-fields.sql
```
**Status**: ✅ DONE (You already ran this!)

### ⚠️ Step 2: Restart Development Server (REQUIRED!)
```bash
# Stop server: Press Ctrl+C
# Start server:
npm run dev
```
**Status**: ⚠️ **DO THIS NOW!**

**Why?** The server needs to reload the database schema to recognize the new logo columns.

### Step 3: Upload & Save Logos
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/settings
2. Click "Logo Settings" tab (🎨)
3. Upload your three logos
4. Click "Save Logo Settings"
5. Page will reload with your logos!

## Current Issue

**Problem**: "Failed to update header config" when saving

**Cause**: Development server is still using old database schema (before migration)

**Fix**: Restart the dev server (Step 2 above)
