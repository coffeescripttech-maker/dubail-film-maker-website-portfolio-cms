# ✅ Database Migration Complete - Restart Server Now!

## Status

✅ **Migration Complete**: Logo columns already exist in your remote database
⚠️ **Action Required**: Restart your development server

## The Issue

Your app is connected to the **remote Cloudflare D1 database**, and the logo columns (`logo_light`, `logo_dark`, `logo_icon`) already exist there. However, your dev server still has the old schema cached.

## Solution (Simple!)

### Stop and Restart Your Dev Server

1. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal
2. **Start the server**: Run `npm run dev`
3. **Try saving logos again**: Should work now!

## Quick Commands

```bash
# In your terminal where npm run dev is running:
Ctrl+C

# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## After Restarting

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/settings
2. Click "Logo Settings" tab
3. Your uploaded logos should still be there
4. Click "Save Logo Settings"
5. ✅ Should work now!

## Why This Happens

- Your app connects to **remote** Cloudflare D1 database
- Logo columns already exist in remote database
- Dev server caches the database schema on startup
- Restart = Fresh schema = Recognizes logo columns

**Just restart your server and you're good to go!** 🚀
